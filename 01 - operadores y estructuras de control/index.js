/*
    * EXERCISE:
    * - Create examples using all types of operators in your language:
    *   Arithmetic, logical, comparison, assignment, identity, membership, bitwise...
    *   (Keep in mind that each language may have different ones)
    * - Using operations with any operators you like, create examples
    *   that represent all types of control structures in your language:
    *   Conditional, iterative, exceptions...
    * - Print the result of all examples to the console.
    *
    * EXTRA CHALLENGE (optional):
    * Create a program that prints all the numbers between 10 and 55 (inclusive)
    * that are even and are neither 16 nor multiples of 3.
    *
    * Surely, by carefully exploring the possibilities, youâ€™ll discover something new.
